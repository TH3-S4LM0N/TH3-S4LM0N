I like rust, use [Fedora Silverblue](https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org/) (or arch sometimes it depends) and [LeftWM](https://github.com/leftwm/leftwm) and maintain the [Fedora package](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/th3-s4lm0n/leftwm/) for it.

this is way too serious i just make random junk for fun
